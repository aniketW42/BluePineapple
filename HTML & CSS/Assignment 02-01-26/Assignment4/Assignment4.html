                <h1>An Introduction to CSS Transitions & Animations</h1>
                <p class="bog-para1">I've noticed in the comments of other posts recently that some readers would like more “tips and tricks” articles, particularly about CSS. So in today's post, I'll be providing what I hope is a useful introduction to a bit of CSS “trickery” that can be used to create compelling microinteractions across your website. Specifically, we'll be learning how to create CSS3 transitions and animations. We'll also be talking about when and where you might want to use them.</p>
                <h2> What Are CSS Transitions and Animations? </h2>
                <p class="bog-para2 ">The evolution of CSS over the years has lead to some really amazing innovations within the language. In the case of transitions and animations, what previously required a program like Adobe Flash or another coding language altogether (such as Javascript) is now possible with nothing but HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p class="bog-para3">This kind of language maturity, enabled by better browsers and higher web standards (among other things), has been a huge boon to web designers who double as front end developers. They can now do more with less and the whole process of web design/development has become a bit easier.</p>
                <p class="bog-para3">Nevertheless, CSS transitions and animations are still considered advanced uses of CSS. A spectrum of coding I try to stay away from in most of my articles since I do not consider myself an “advanced developer”–even in language as accessible as HTML or CSS. </p>
